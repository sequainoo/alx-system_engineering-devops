# webstack monitoring

## Monitoring
Collecting, processing, aggregating and displaying real time metrics about a system.
The purpose of this activity perhaps would be to analyse trends, see how the system
is performing now agianst before, alert when something is about to break or when
something breaks etc.

In monitoring a software system, we collect metrics about the application and the
hardware resources.
In Applicaiton performance management we monitor the application to strive to detect and
diagnose perfrmance issues.
And these metrics can be in two groups: metrics about how an end user sees/experience the application
and metrics about the system resources used by the application.

### Metrics about how the user experience the application
These metrics are collected based on two components the `load` and the `response times`.

### Metrics on the system resources used by the application
They include usage of CPU, memory, disk etc
